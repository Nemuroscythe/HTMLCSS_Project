            Hello ! Me? I am Jeremy Alen, young software developper of 26 years old.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like to read, play video games, role play with friends and running.
            I read mostly manga with a wide variety of genre, but I also like to read
            book with a preference for fantasy and mystery (like "And then they were none").
            As for video games I also like a lot of them, especially the indie games,
            but my favorite genre is definetly RPG. Talking of role playing game, I have
            the chance to have friends to play with IRL and we will begin a new one : "Knight".
            Knight place the action in a post-apocalypse where monsters dominate the world.
            A group of mercenary equiped with mech-armor try to gives humanity a hope by taking
            the name of famous character in the Arthurian legend.

            On this website, I would like to show you one subject that I want to learn
            about (the creation of plug-in) and another thing that I want you to learn about
            (Digimon World).
