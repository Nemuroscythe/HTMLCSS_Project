        <p>I quite like the idea of an application that can scale itself
            depending of the need of some users and plug-in application are -in my opinion-
            the way to go. The ability to give your users some customization is great.
            Besides, it helps the improvement of our application in a non destructive way.
            Some plug-ins may end up in the application if the majority of users may use it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The possible use of plug-ins in our application must be given a thought,
            as we need to create a way of working/communicating with them. We need to
            be able to register plug-ins (to activate them and only use load them as we need),
            and we also need to create a protocol for communication.
