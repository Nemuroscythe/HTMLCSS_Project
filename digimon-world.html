        <p>
            Digimon World is a video game by Bandai on the PlayStation,
            released in 1999, about the Digimon virtual pets.
        </p>

        <p>
            First video game on console of the franchise, Digimon world need to introduce
            the franchise to many, as the original digivice -the digimon virtual pet- never
            got released in Europe. The intro shows the essentiel we need to know, we see
            the digivice, hear about digivolution, and see a combat against ultimate digimons.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the game begins, an old man talks to us and introduces
            himself as <del>the professeur</del> Jijimon, a digimon.
            After answering his questions about us, we see our character
            -a middle schooler- coming back home to find his own
            digivice shining. The digivice absorbs him and next thing we
            know we find ourselves in the middle of many monsters : the digimons.
            We find again Jijimon that explains that we are in the digiworld, in
            File city. File city was a big city full of life and digimons until
            the digimons began to forget -one by one- who they were. Our mission :
            finding digimons to live in the city. But how? we are only a kid.
            The answer lies behind us : our own digimon (agumon or gabumon depending
            of our answer to Jijimon)!
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point you may think :"Yeah, a pokemon like in 3D, nothing special". You are wrong!
            There are many differences and if somes may seam trivial, they have a huge impact on
            the manner that you play.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, there is absolutely no question to "catch them all", we only have one digimon.
            Isn't a waste to only play one digimon as there as so many in the game ? No,
            because even though we only have one, it won't live forever ! Exactely, our digimon
            will die and reincarnate into an egg that will bring to life another kind of
            digimon. It may die in battle of course, but it may also die of old age!
        </p>

        <p>
            Second, our digimon digivolve ! Like in pokemon ? Obviously not ! Even if our
            digimon have stats, there is no actual level. Our digimon may even digivolve into
            many differents forms. Depending of his age, our digimon will digivolve, and the form it will
            takes will depends of his stats. The stages of our digimon will be : Baby, In-training,
            Rookie, Champion and Ultimate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's talk about our digimon. We already know that it has stats, a stage and an age.
            Well, it also has a name, skills, 3 lives (for death in combat), an happiness meter,
            a discipline meter and a dirty meter, at least that is what we can see at the beginning.
            Our digimon will get hungry, sleepy or pressed to go to the toilet (I'm not joking).
            If we takes care of him, he will be happy, and if we teach him how to behave, his
            discipline will go up. We can felicite him for behaving well or scold him if he does
            something bad like shitting in the wild. For training him, we way fight with other
            digimon but we may also go to the training facility to raise a particular stat
            (which is important for controling the digivolution).
        </p>

        <p>
            And the combat system ? It relies on giving orders to our digimon,
            but as you would expect by now, it's not by selecting the skill to use
            turn by turn. The fight occurs in realtime,
            our digimon can utilize up to 4 skills (that we may change anytime) and the
            orders that with gives to him is only related to his comportement : attack, defense,
            take some distance, change cible, ... All theses orders will be available depending
            of the intelligence (stat) of our digimon.
        </p>

        <p>
            The last main difference is about File city. Our progression is
            evaluated via the number of digimon that we have brought back : the prosperity
            of File city. Each digimon depending of his stage will bring us some prosperity
            but that is not the only thing that they do. Many digimons will work for the city
            , by opening a shop, an hospital a restaurent,... . Others will upgrade thoses
            buildings and the rest will only give us advices. Besides all that, we can also
            go fishing, play curling, exchange objets, fast travel or play the arena.
        </p>

        <p>
            All theses things together will help you feel concerns about theses digimons and
            particularly your own companion. This game is much more about travelling and
            bonding with your digimon than anything else. The story is great, you can
            advance at you own pace and discover the digiworld the way you want.
