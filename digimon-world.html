        <h1>Digimon World</h1>

        <p>
            Digimon World is a video game by Bandai on the PlayStation,
            released in 1999, about the Digimon virtual pets.
        </p>
        <p>
            First video game on console of the franchise, Digimon world need to introduce
            the franchise to many, as the original digivice -the digimon virtual pet- never
            got released in Europe. The intro show the essentiel we need to know, we see
             the digivice, hear about digivolution, and see a combat against ultimate digimon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the game begin, an old man talk to us and introduce
            himself as <del>the professeur</del> Jijimon, a digimon.
            After answering his questions about us, we see our character
             -a middle schooler- coming back home to find his own 
             digivice shining. The digivice absorbs him and next thing we
             know we find ourselves in the middle of many monsters : the digimons.
            We find again Jijimon that explains that we are in the digiworld, in
            File city. File city was a big city full of life and digimons until
             the digimon began to forget -one by one- who they were. Our mission :
             finding digimon to live in the city. But how? we are only a kid.
             The answer lies behind us : our own digimon (agumon or gabumon depending
             of our answer to Jijimon).

            At this point you may think :"Yeah, a pokemon like in 3D". You are wrong!
